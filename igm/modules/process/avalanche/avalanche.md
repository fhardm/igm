### <h1 align="center" id="title">IGM avalanche module  </h1>

# Description:

This IGM module permits to model redistribution of snow due to avalanches.
This routine move ice/snow downslope until the ice surface is everywhere
at angle of repose. This function was adapted from 
[Mark Kessler's GC2D](https://github.com/csdms-contrib/gc2d)
program and implemented in IGM by JÃ¼rgen Mey with support from Guillaume Jouvet.
 
Modified exit strategy, annotated and documented by Andreas Henz

The redistribution of snow is done in each specific time step `aval_update_freq` and based on a maximum slope angle `aval_angleOfRepose`. Basically, the ice is redistributed downwards in an iterative process to achieve a maximum surface slope (in the code a maximum height difference between neighboring grid cells). This iterative process is stopped when the average distributed ice is less than a certain thickness `aval_stop_redistribution_thk`. This initial value (recommended between 1-5 cm) was determined by looking at the amount of ice distributed at each time step. If very little ice is distributed, we stop the loop and save computation time.
